# Vectors
A Kotlin implementation of some vector math stuff

## What is this?
This is literally just a bunch of classes: Vector2, Vector3, Vector4 and Quaternion.
And also some helpful functions to operate with those.

Feel absolutely free to suggest any math mistake correction or any functions I have forgotten in the issues section.

## How to use
1. Go to the releases tab
2. Grab a jar
3. In IntelliJ IDEA, open Project Structure (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S)
4. Navigate to Modules page, Dependencies tab
- Also make sure you have selected the correct module in the list 
5. Click the + button
6. Select "JARs or directories..."
7. Find the jar in the explorer and click it
8. I hope it should be ready to go

## Possible issues
If you multiply a number by a vector and it gives out an error, write `import me.altered.vectors.*` AKA import literally everything.
